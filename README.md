# Media-Player

This is an application that I created during my C++ class at Télécom Paris. it amims to created a sort of remote control that plays a media (for example a video or a photo) in your computer by providing to the remote its path.
Since it is not completed yet, I made it in private, but when I will finish it, then I will make it public so that anyone can see this program.
